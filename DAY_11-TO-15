I STARTED BIT MANIPULATION IN VERY VERY DEEP........


     LEARN ABOUT BITWISE OPERATORS AND ITS WORKING :--->
     
         1) BITWISE AND (&) OPERATOR.
         2) BITWISE OR  (|) OPERATOR.
         3) BITWISE NOT (!) OPERATOR.
         4) BITWISE XOR (^) OPERATOR.
         
         program is uploaded as a file ::--->>
         
         AFTER THIS I LEARN ABOUT BITWISE LEFT SHIFT AND BITWISE RIGHT SHIFT :->
         
            1) LEFT SHIFT ( << ) OPERATOR.
            2) RIGHT SHIFT ( >> ) OPERATOR .
            
      
      PROGRAMS--->
      
      1)  AFTER THAT I LEARN HOW TO COUNT THE SET BITS  :->
          
       3 WAYS -
            1) KNIVE APPROCH
            2) BRIAN KERNINGHAM METHOD 
            3) USING INBUILT FXN [__builtin_popcount(n)].
            
      2)  CHECK WETHER A NUMBER IS EVEN OR ODD
      3)  CLACULATING THE POWER OF 2^N .
      4)
