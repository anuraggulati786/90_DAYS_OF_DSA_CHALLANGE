I STARTED BIT MANIPULATION IN VERY VERY DEEP........


     LEARN ABOUT BITWISE OPERATORS AND ITS WORKING :--->
     
         1) BITWISE AND (&) OPERATOR.
         2) BITWISE OR  (|) OPERATOR.
         3) BITWISE NOT (!) OPERATOR.
         4) BITWISE XOR (^) OPERATOR.
         
         program is uploaded as a file ::--->>
         
         AFTER THIS I LEARN ABOUT BITWISE LEFT SHIFT AND BITWISE RIGHT SHIFT :->
         
            1) LEFT SHIFT ( << ) OPERATOR.
            2) RIGHT SHIFT ( >> ) OPERATOR .
            
      
      PROGRAMS--->
      
      1)  AFTER THAT I LEARN HOW TO COUNT THE SET BITS  :->
          
       3 WAYS -
            1) KNIVE APPROCH
            2) BRIAN KERNINGHAM METHOD 
            3) USING INBUILT FXN [__builtin_popcount(n)].
            
      2)  CHECK WETHER A NUMBER IS EVEN OR ODD
      3)  CLACULATING THE POWER OF 2^N .
      4)  FINDING UNIQUE ELEMENT INSIDE AN ARRAY UISING XOR OPERATION .
      5)  FINDING FIRST SET BIT (HERE ASSUME FIRST POSITION IS STARTING FROM 1)..
      6)  FINDING RIGHT MOST DIFFERENT BIT.
      7)  CHECK WETHER THE KTH BIT IS SET OR NOT.
      8)  PROGRAM TO FIND TOTAL NUMBER OF FLIPS REQUIRED TO CONVERT A TO B .
      9)  CHECK WETHER A NUMBER IS SPRASE OR NOT .
      10) FINDING LENGTH OF LONGEST CONSECUTIVE ONES IN AN BINARY.
      11) PROGRAM TO CALCULATE MAXIMUM AND VALUE  OF A PAIR .
      
           CODE IS ALREADY ADDED IN MAIN LIST ..
