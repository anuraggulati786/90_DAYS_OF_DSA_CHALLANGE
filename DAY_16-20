I STARTED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DATA STRUCTURE NAMED AS 
                              
                                          
                                               *** ARRAY ***
                                               
                                               
                            CLEAR THE BASICS FIRST :
                            
                            1) ONE DIMENSION ARRAY
                            2) 2 DIMENSION ARRAY
                            3) ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE ARRAY 
                            4) ARRAY VS OTHER DATA STRUCTURE 
                            5) OPERATIONS IN ARRAY:
                              
                                1) TRAVERSAL
                                2) LINEAR SEARCH
                                3) INSERION IN ARRAY
                                4) DELETION IN ARRAY
                                5) BINARY SEARCH IN ARRAY 
                                6) MERGING TWO SORTED ARRAY 
                                7) REVERSING AN ARRAY 
                                
                                
                        # SOME IMPORTANT PROGRAMS TO PRACTICE ON ARRAYS :
                        
                          1) DUPLICATE VALUE DELETION FROM AN ARRAY 
                          2) FINDING FREQUENCY OF ALL THE UNIQUE ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY 
                          3) FINDING HOW MANY DISTINCT ELEMENTS IS PRESENT IN AN ARRAY
                         
                        # SOME MOST FREQUENT QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED IN  INTERVIEWS AS WELL 
                          1) PROGRAM FOR ARRAY ROTATION LEFT ROTATION CLOCKWISE 
                             i)  USING TEMP VARIABLE 
                             ii) USING REVERSAL ALGORITHM 
                          2) PROGRAM TO CYCLICALLY ROTATE AN ARRAY BY ONE (CLOCKWISE)
                          3) SEARCH AN ELEMENT IN A SORTED AND ROTATED ARRAY (IMPORTANT QUES AND CONCEPT AS WELL) PREFFER GFG FOR LEARNING AND LEETCODE FOR PRACTICING IT ...
